# interactiveSVG
For MMED 3039's interactive information poster assignment!

Welcome to my interactive SVG assignment!

1. To start, turn on MAMP servers and place this whole project into htdocs

2. import the database for this project (titled data.sql) in PHPmyAdmin

3. with your desktop on fullscreen, navigate to localhost:8888 and select this project

4. scroll gently, preferably with a trackpad, and watch the animation come to life!


I used wow js animations to animate this whole thing, here's the link to use it too!
